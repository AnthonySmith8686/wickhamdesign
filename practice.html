          <h5>Overview:</h5>

          <p>Wickham Design Practice is based in London and is driven to produce high quality buildings and public spaces.
          The practice's interests lie in helping its clients get the most from their site and in delivering original,
          beautiful places in which to live and work. </p>
          <h5>Approach:</h5>

          <p>We aim to produce work that will age well, and we deliver this through good design, working closely with clients,
            and the careful management of the procurement and construction process.
          A room or building should form the best possible backdrop to the life that is lived within it.
          In order to do this, the spatial and material qualities that characterise it must be attuned to the site and the daily rituals of its users.
          The materials chosen and their detailing help to develop the appropriate atmosphere.
          The work is focused on creating a sense of coherence between new and existing elements of each project rather than on a particular
          style or aesthetic.</p>

          <h5>Matt Wickham:</h5>

          <p>Matt has diverse experience, having worked both within the Architectural Profession and as a site foreman for a construction company.
          This gives him a unique perspective on producing well designed and constructed buildings.
          Matt has worked for several award winning architectural practices including Dow Jones Architects and Threefold Architects.
          Before leaving Threefold Architects he was Project Architect for the redevelopment of a house on Brick Lane, which was subsequently nominated for the Architectâ€™s Journal Small Project Award 2016.
          Whilst working on site, Matt was responsible for managing the building team, overseeing the various trades and their works each day.
          He liaised with the design team, including Architects, interior and lighting designers and gained valuable insight from working in this role.</p>
