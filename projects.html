The refurbishment and extension of the ground floor of a Victorian house in South London. The  small, cold conservatory was replaced with a new garden room suitable for use throughout the year. The kitchen and utility room  were also redesigned so that they are filled with light throughout the day.
The plan has been reorganised around a sheltered inner courtyard garden that the existing rooms and new rear extension are linked to through the large oak doors and sash windows. This courtyard and the terrace facing on to the main garden are treated as one of a series of connected rooms that are landscaped with planting and materials to reinforce this. The brushed limestone flooring used internally is the same type as the smaller limestone blocks laid in the courtyard. Similarly, the reclaimed London stock bricks have been used internally around the stove as well as forming the walls of the extension.
Careful detailing of the brickwork  and  doors and windows give a quality to the construction that sits comfortably next to the fabric of the existing Victorian building.

          The complete refurbishment of a flat spread across the top three floors of a Victorian terrace building in the Maida Vale Conservation Area.
          Much of the work done to this home was to change the layout of the bedrooms and bathrooms to create a more efficient arrangement, creating a double bedroom on the south facing side of the flat from what was a small study.
          The  staircase and hallways have been redesigned with a large roof light above them that drops light into the lower floors of the flat. The open tread oak staircase and timber screens rise through the building, and light filters through these elements into the surrounding spaces.
          The kitchen was relocated to create a  better connection between the living space and the roof terrace. The kitchen joinery was designed to sit below the pitched roof around the dormer window, maximising the use of the available storage space whilst creating a more coherent kitchen/dining area.

        <p>This project extended and adapted the existing kitchen and living spaces to take advantage of the views from the high vantage point.
The project was successful as much due to what was removed as what was added, taking away a dilapidated outhouse gave the opportunity for a large picture window to be inserted in the kitchen. This approach helped to achieve a lot with a modest budget.</p>

        <p>  The refurbishment of a 1960s flat.

    By making better use of the existing space, it was possible to remove the small kitchenette from the living space and create a separate kitchen and new bathroom. Attention was paid to removing and reducing the size of the boxing out for services that was in many of the rooms.
    Light coloured cork flooring has been used in the living room and bedrooms to improve the acoustic qualities of the rooms and give a cleaner, brighter finish than had existed. Storage has been carefully considered to minimise clutter throughout the flat.
    The project was recently completed and photographs will soon be added to this site.</p>

        <p>  The refurbishment of a 1960s flat.</p>

          <p>A competition entry for the Langley Vale Woodland Visitor's centre, sited in a new woodland being planted south of Epsom Downs.</p>
      <p>Our proposal is a building with weight, mass and a sense of permanence within a changing and developing site. The present condition of the woodland is very different to that planned for 50 or 100 years time and so this building has been designed to make sense of these changing surroundings. It does this through two main means:</p>
      <p>Firstly, through the scale and the solidity of its construction, lending the building a a monumental quality when seen either standing alone across a field or discovered surrounded by trees.</p>
      <p>Secondly, by making the building another experience that is part of a longer walk through the woodland. Access at both ends allows visitors to filter through the rows of large columns into the central space, like the clearing in a woodland and then back out of the other end to the landscape beyond. The central space detaches the visitor a little from the landscape outside, focusing on the sky and the light coming in from the clerestory windows. The landscape is visible glimpsed through the rows of columns at either end. The interior is one of a series of spaces one experiences when walking through the woodland paths and clearings.</p>
      <p>Using the timber’s massive quality in a similar manner to traditional log-wall construction (the timbers laid on their side rather than used as part of a lightweight frame) would allow the use of lower grade timber.</p>

        <p>This project involved reconnecting four individual flats into one house in a Listed Building in Blackheath and organising the newly joined spaces into a cohesive family home.</p>
        <p>The project involved some interesting and technically challenging aspects such as the reuse of timber boards from the site, the restoration of ornate plaster cornices  and the construction of large concrete counter tops and island units.</p>
        <p>Matt worked for the Contractor as Site Foreman during the construction of the project and oversaw every element of the works. Working with Architects, and tradesmen and running the works from a Contractor's perspective was an extremely informative and valuable experience.</p>

                  A feasibility study for a new Mews House in South London.
                  The proposal is for a new home laid out in a split level arrangement, with a series of private outdoor
                  spaces that avoid overlooking the neighbouring properties.
                  Due to the proximity of neighbouring houses and gardens,
                  overlooking is a possible issue, and doors and windows have been arranged to look inwards into the hidden courtyard garden,
                  with roof lights used to bring in additional light.
                  At the lowest level, the bedroom accommodation opens onto a partially sunken courtyard garden.
                  Above this, the kitchen and dining room connect to a terrace that also forms part of the courtyard.
                  The top floor living space joins a private roof terrace
                  Internally, the different levels are connected vertically by a full height void that brings additional
                  light into the rooms on the north facing side of the building.
                  Splitting the level of the house and sinking the south facing side of the house below ground level
                  as allowed a generous amount of outdoor garden space to be created on a relatively small plot.</p>
